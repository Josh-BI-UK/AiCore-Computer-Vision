##AiCore Module - Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors

In my AiCore Bootcamp course, I had to create a "Rock - Paper - Scissors" game that was based on Deep Learning.

Learning Objective: Using a webcam streaming video image, build a deep learning model that recognizes a player's gestures (e.g. either Rock, Paper, Scissors) and correctly analyses them.

End Goal: Create a Python-based "Rock, Paper Scissors" game against the computer using the above logic.
